      <h2>Curriculum</h2>
      <p><b>NOTE</b> On July 22, 2020 the ML PhD curriculum requirements were slightly modified. In a follow up email on Aug. 3, 2020, it was made clear tht "current students (any student entering 202002 or prior) have the option to remain on the previous curriculum in the catalog year that they entered, or may choose to follow the new curriculum (catalog year 202005)."</p>
      <p>Because of this, below, where appropriate, I'll try to link to old versions of the curriculum instead of what is live right now<p>

      <p>In addition to meeting the five core area requirements, each student is required to complete five elective courses.  These courses are required for getting a complete breadth in ML. These courses must be chosen from at least two of the following five subject areas: Statistics and Applied Probability, Advanced Theory, Applications, Computing and Optimization, and Platforms. In addition, students can use up to six special topics research hours towards this requirement.</p>

      <h4>Responsible Conduct of Research</h4>
      <p>Georgia Tech requires that all PhD students complete an RCR requirement that consists of an online component and in-person training. The online component is completed during the student’s first semester enrolled at Georgia Tech.  The in-person training is satisfied by taking PHIL 6000 or their associated academic program’s in-house RCR course.</p>

      <h4>Doctoral Minor</h4>
      <p>The minor follows the standard Georgia Tech requirement: 9 hours outside the student’s home unit, with a GPA in those courses of at least 3.0.  These courses are in addition to the other core and elective requirements.  The courses for the minor should form a cohesive program of study, outside the area of ML, that is approved by the Faculty Advisory Committee.  Typical programs will consist of three courses from the same school (any school at the Institute) or three courses from the same elective area.</p>

      <p><b>UPDATE</b> Oct. 17, 2019: ML PhD Academic Advisor Stephanie Niebuhr said the following to me in an email inquiry about the process for approving a minor...<br>
      <blockquote>For the minor, your faculty advisor should approve which 3 courses should form your minor of study.  There is a form through grad studies that must be signed by your faculty advisor and then you will be sent to me for approval: <a href="https://grad.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/doctoral_minor_form.pdf">LINK</a>. <b>This is not completed until after the thesis is approved</b>, so there is no need to complete the form now, but you should talk to your advisor about it if you haven't already. As long as they are outside of your home school, not in the ML curriculum, and are a cohesive topic, then it should be fine with faculty advisor approval.</blockquote></p>

      <h4><a href="https://ml.gatech.edu/content/curriculum-phd-dissertation" target="_blank">Qualifying examination</a></h4>
      <p>The Ph.D. qualifying exam consists of a focused literature review that will take place over the course of one semester. At the beginning of the second semester of their second year, a qualifying committee consisting of three members of the ML faculty will assign, in consultation with the student and the student’s advisor, a course of study consisting of influential papers, books, or other intellectual artifacts relevant to the student’s research interests. The student’s focus area and current research efforts (and related portfolio) will be considered in defining the course of study.</p>
      <p>At the end of the semester, the student will submit a written report the demonstrates their understanding of both the technical content and the context of each artifact.  Subsequently, the student will have a closed oral exam with the three members of the committee.The exam will be interactive, with the student and the committee discussing and criticizing each work and posing questions related to the student's current research to determine the breadth of student’s knowledge in that specific area.<p>
