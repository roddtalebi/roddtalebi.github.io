    <h2>Team Goals</h2>
    I have several goals for this team; both long and short term. This next year will be strictly developmental in replacing rowers and a culture that allow for selfish actions, low standards for competition, lack of comitment, and a void of structure. By doing that, I hope to see Georgia Tech Women's Rowing return to the top of the podium for the 8+s at SIRA within 2-3 years, and at ACRA within 5 years. I will also be working closely with Brian to have the novice program reflect the expectations of the varsity program.
    
    <h2>Coaching Style</h2>
    I have chosen not to have assistant coaches by relying on the coxswains to fill the role as leaders within the boat. I will do my best to be explicit in what I expect technically from each rower so that eventually, each rower and each boat can essentially coach themselves. I will be very hands on during the Fall semester and then shift to giving more responsibility to the rowers and coxswains especially after lineups are set. A successful athlete in my program is one who quickly takes advantage of the resources around them to learn the stroke and to learn their weaknesses, so that they can individually work on what they need to be successful in the Spring while motivating their teammates to do the same. The relationship between the individual rower and the whole team must be reciprocal in nature such that the success of the rower means the success of the team and the success of the team means the success of the individual. 


    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    Monday - Wednesday: 5am leave campus, on the water by 5:30am, off the water by 7:00am, campus by 8:00am.<br>
    Thursday: Land Workout at CRC 6:30am<br>
    Friday: off<br>
    Saturday: on the water for morning practice<br>
    Sunday: either on the water in the mornings or at CRC for easy cardio switching every other week<br>
    
    <h2>Race Schedule</h2>
    We will likely not stack boats in the Fall until maybe HOTS. I'm more interested in setting relatively even boats and seeing who steps up to give their boat extra speed. I don't view these as opportunities to race other schools, these are opportunities to just race.<br>In the spring I'd like to try and do more scrimmages to build the racing experience. We will not attend FIRA; instead I will entertain the idea of doing a race for tanks with other local schools: UGA, Clemson, Emory.<br>SIRA will likely be the last race for most of the crew. Dad Vail Regatta is a highly competitive race and ACRA is a Club National Championship and we will treat it as such. It is up to the judgement of the coachs' to determine what boats to race at the latter two races, but all are welcome to attend and support the team. Any boat that is planning on racing and will be competitive at ACRA will likely be given an invitation to row at Dad Vail; any boat that medalled at SIRA will also likely be given an invitation to row at Dad Vail.<br>
    Events that I will be focusing on are the heavyweight 8 events, and the heavyweight 4 events. We will fill boats in other events if we need to race rowers. My goal is to elevate the Georgia Tech Women's Rowing to a nationaly ranked top 5 programs; racing in lightweight events does not do that.
    
    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    Mandatory. Illness excused with note. Common illness inexcuseable.
    
    <h2>Team Captains</h2>
    Two captains will be selected by the squad to hold non-officer leadership positions within the squad. Coxswains will be exempt from these roles as this is already expected from them.
    
    <h2>Varsity Criteria</h2>
    Rowers will be expected to have a a maximum 2k time of 8:30.00 Anyone who cannot meet this standard by the end of the previous winter semester will be asked to continue as a coxswains for the future season.
    
    <h2>Coxswains</h2>
    Expectations of coxswains will be increased significantly. I expect them all to perform on the level of assistant coaches to myself. A coxswain bootcamp will be held prior to the first week of school.
