    The Georgia Tech Rowing Team Officer Board have engaged in negociations with Rodd Talebi to serve as the club's new Varsity Woemen's Head Coach.<br><br>

    Talebi has most recently served as the club's Assistant Varsity Coach. He has been part of the Tech coaching staff for the past two seasons, after spending his first year coaching at his alma mater, UCLA.<br><br>

    Contract negociations are expected to continue for several weeks until all officers aprove the structural changes introduced by Talebi.<br><br>

    "I've seen tremendous growth from this team since I joined it in 2015," said Rodd, "but there is still a lot that we can do to improve. I've already began indept discussions with Coach Mike and Coach Brian to see how we can get all our squads on the same page. Team culture is extremely important to me; whether novice or varsity, men or women, Georgia Tech Crew needs to collectively step up if we ever want to hold a national presense. There are going to be a lot of changes on my squad to get there, and I expect a lot of pushback, but it is a necessary step to take."<br><br>

    Talebi will be taking the place of Coach Jay Skuban who is retiring from his role after being with the team for six years. In that time, the women's squad went from racing a single 4+ to putting out three 8+s. Skuban was pivitol in bringing the women's squad back into the top 10 club rankings.<br><br>

    Despite a dominating Fall season, the team finished the Spring season well under expectations. Coach Rodd wants to approach the next year as an opportunity to rebuild and redevelop the team.<br><br>
