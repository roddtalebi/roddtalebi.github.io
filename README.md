# My Personal Website
To serve several purposes:

 * clean way to post resume and offer detail
 * have a single source to keep track of stuff I've been up to in my life...documenting life so it doesn't get forgotten

## Layout
I'm thinking of having a massive 'one pager' website and have the navar jump to points later in the page. Each section will then offer links to other pages. Follow a similar format to the recruiting site I made for rowing...each section divided in half, left + right, such that one is an image and the other is content with links.

## Sections

 * summary page; who I am. links to instagram + github + linkedin + pdf resume
 * maybe one as a 'work specific' section; break down the work I've done and possibly link to github or other stuff
